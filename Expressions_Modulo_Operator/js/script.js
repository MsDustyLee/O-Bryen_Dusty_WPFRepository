//Expressions - Modulo Operator

/* If we coded our expression as 32 divided by 10:

var remainder = 32 / 10;
console.log(remainder)

we would get an answer of 3.2, which can be seen on the console.

But, to get the actual remainder we need to use the percent symbol.
 */

var remainder = 32 % 10;
console.log(remainder);
