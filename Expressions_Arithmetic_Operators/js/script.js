//area of a triangle is half of the width times the height

var width = 4;
var height = 5;
var area = width * height / 2;
/* using the names of the variables means we can change the value
of width and the value of height at any time, and still make
the variable area correct.  If we had used:

var area = 4*5/2;

then we would have also had to go in to change the values in the declaration
of area as well.  Just takes more time and leaves more room for error.
