//Condition with Expressions - If and Else: Choosing between two blocks of code

/*

var kidHeight = 47;
var minHeight = 48;

if(kidHeight > minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the roller coaster!");
}

if(kidHeight <= minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is false
    console.log("Sorry, you've got some growing to do!");
}

Or,

 var kidHeight = 48;
 var minHeight = 48;

 if(kidHeight > minHeight){
 console.log("You can ride the roller coaster!");
 }

 if(kidHeight <= minHeight){
 console.log("Sorry, you've got some growing to do!");
 }

//Can do the expression as the forms above, but the easier way is:

var kidHeight = 47;
var minHeight = 48;

if(kidHeight > minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the roller coaster!");
}else{
    //code performed if condition is false
    console.log("Sorry, you've got some growing to do!");
