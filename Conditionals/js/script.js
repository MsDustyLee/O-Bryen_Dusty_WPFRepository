//CONDITIONAL LOGIC - BASIC CONDITIONAL STATEMENT:

// if(condition){action/s}

var oldEnough = true;

//if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"

if(oldEnough){
    console.log("You can ride the roller coaster!");

} //code performed if condition is true

/*if the var oldEnough were false, meaning not old enough, then it will skip
the information going to the console.
